# x64 Assembly - NASM Compactible

This is an attempt to understand the x64 Assembly language for exploring the computers to their depth. I love computers, especially the structure on which they are working on i.e. low level structure.

I am fond of retro computer and I am figuring out how they work. Although I am not a expert, I am trying the explore and research on it. This repository the place where I am archiving my journey. Incase you find some thing that you wanna share about low level computing, please let me know.

It would be great if you share the knowledge with me as I am a beginner, as I will be in next hundred years.

## 🚀 About Me

I am a Ethical Hacker and Cyber Security Enthusiast with an infinite intrest in computers, especially low level programming. Electronics and Low Level Development is my current interest (although they are highly variable). This is due to binary exploitation that I was learning. I am also a developer, I built some awesome personal projects and I love working in my own space.
